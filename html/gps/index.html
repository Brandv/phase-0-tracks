<!-- Semantic tags are used to assign meaning to code and the webpage. They are not for most users but for other coders who review code or those with special needs to better nagivate and interpret a webpage. I think Section is the most useful tag because I believe it is the closest thing to <div>'s main use as a layout container.
browsers display elements I believe from top to bottom.
I learned that sublime has many handy features and tools that I will need to explore yet it's still not the preferred text editor for many coders. And of course i'll be creating as many snippets to make my life as easy as possible.
The hardest part was just learning and researching something completely new and not having the luxury to go at my own pace because I'm in a timed pairing session. Understanding nesting order for new tags is something I need to improve. Like, how would I know the CDATA goes inside the content tag? I'm going to read up on this stuff and experiment more.
