Look up an overview of what jquery is.
search for a tutorial. try it out. 
practice as you learn to make sure concepts make sense.
check out w3schools jquery.

Going through a step by step tutorial seemed most effective, even if it takes longer. However, I did not feel comfortable with basic JS so the step by step learning was necessary.
