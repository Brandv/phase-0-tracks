<h1>a quick primer on stuttering!</h1>
<p><strong>What is stuttering?</strong></p>
<p>Stuttering is a communication disorder that results in disfluncies or discoordinations of speech production. The most common type of stuttering, <em>Developmental Stuttering</em> occurs between the ages of 2 and 8 when a child first begins speaking. It is common for many children to have disfluencies during this time, with the vast majority eventually growing out of it. Stuttering affects approximately 1% of the world's population and there are around 3 million people who stutter in the United States.</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<ul>
	<li><i class="question">Can I finish a stutterer's word or sentence if I know what they are going to say?</i><br>
	While every person who stutters is different and has their own preferences, the general rule is to let the person finish all of their words on their own. Listeners also guess incorrectly oftentimes which can make the interaction longer and more strained for both the stutterer and listener.</li>
	<li><i class="question">Do you stutter because you are nervous?</i><br>
	Stuttering is not caused by nervousness or anxiety, but it can exacerbate the difficulty in speaking. Some people are more reactive to this than others. It can be particularly challenging when fear of stuttering is what leads to anxiety, which in turns makes stuttering more likely and thus reinforces said fear. This can become a vicious cycle.
	</li>
	<li><i class="question">What should I do when talking to someone who stutters?</i><br>
	When speaking with someone who stutters you should basically treat them as you would anyone else. The thing to keep in mind would be to show patience and let them finish their words on their own.
